# noCrutch
First React application i coded without using crutches like create-react-app or React-scripts (a library developed alongside it). 
Utilizing the MERN stack alongside webpack and some other supporting libraries i created my first shell e-commerce site, utilizing
a MongoDB database as well as REST api's and Axios to serve database entries directly onto the frontend UI.
