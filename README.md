# noCrutch
First React application i coded without using crutches like create-react-app or React-scripts (a library developed alongside it). 
Utilizing the MERN stack alongside webpack, i created my first shell e-commerce site, additionally utilizing Axios and REST API's
to serve database entries directly onto the frontend UI.
